"""Shared fixtures.

Two things need care here, both consequences of how the app is built:

* `app.config` reads `CONFIG_PATH` at **import** time, so `CONFIG_PATH` has to be
  set before anything imports `app.*`. That happens at the top of this module,
  which pytest loads before collecting any test.
* Almost all of the interesting state is module-global and process-local by
  design (see the invariants in AGENTS.md). Tests therefore have to reset it
  between cases or they leak into each other — `reset_state` does that, and it is
  autouse so no test can forget.
