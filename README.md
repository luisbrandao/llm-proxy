# LLM Proxy

OpenAI-compatible reverse proxy for **multiple LLM backends**, with **priority-based
load balancing**, per-backend **concurrency limits (slots)**, automatic **failover**,
a bearer-key **permission gate**, **Prometheus metrics**, **token counting**, and
**structured logging**.

Drop it between your LLM clients (Open WebUI, OpenCode, LangChain, any OpenAI SDK, …)
and any number of upstream backends (DeepSeek, Ollama hosts, OpenRouter, …). Clients
request a **clean model name** — the proxy decides *which* backend actually serves it.

## Highlights

- **Transparent routing** — clients use a plain model name (`deepseek-v4-flash`,
  `local.qwen-medium:low`); no need to know which server runs it.
- **Priority + slots** — prefer your fast/cheap backend, cap concurrency per backend,
  and **queue** requests when every candidate is busy.
- **Swap-aware queueing** — when a local backend frees up, the queue prefers a request
  for the model it *already has loaded*, so it isn't made to swap out a model it is
  about to need again.
- **Failover** — if a backend errors, the request retries the next one; offline
  backends drop out of the model list and are skipped.
- **In-flight visibility** — the console's In-flight tab lists every request currently
  running or queued, what each one is waiting on, and how long it has waited.
- **Permission gate** — mark paid backends `require_permission: true`; only callers
  with a valid `Authorization: Bearer` key see or use them.
- **OpenRouter provider routing** — pin which upstream OpenRouter uses (e.g. force
  DeepSeek-official instead of whatever's cheapest).
- **Claude on your subscription** — a `kind: claude-cli` backend runs the official
  Claude Code CLI headless inside the container, so Claude routes like any other
  backend and draws from your Claude plan instead of an API key.
- **Response decompression** — transparently decodes gzip/deflate/brotli upstream
  bodies that a client couldn't otherwise read.

## How routing works

A client sends a **canonical model name** — a clean, provider-agnostic id. Native
(provider-specific) ids never leak to clients. The proxy resolves the canonical name to
an ordered list of **targets** (a real native model on a real backend), then admits the
request to the highest-priority target that has a free slot.

Two layers turn native ids into canonical names: a backend's `model_map` (per-provider
native↔canonical dictionary) and the `models:` block (cross-provider routing table). They
compose — the logical model picks the backends and order; each backend's `model_map`
supplies the native id. See [Canonical names](#canonical-names).

**Resolution order:**
1. **Alias** — a global short name → `provider:canonical` (e.g. `chat` → `deepseek:deepseek-v4-pro`).
2. **Explicit `provider:model`** — forces one backend (the model part is canonical, rewritten to native).
3. **Logical model** — a `models:` entry mapping one canonical name to several prioritized targets.
4. **Auto-group** — the same canonical name served by multiple backends is load-balanced
   automatically, ordered by each backend's `priority` (no config needed).
5. **Allow-listed backend** — a backend whose `enabled_models` names it explicitly.

If none of those match, the request gets a **404 `model_not_found`** — the proxy never
picks a backend on the client's behalf:

```json
{"error": {"message": "The model 'x' does not exist or is not available on this proxy",
           "type": "invalid_request_error", "param": "model", "code": "model_not_found"}}
```

> **This used to be a last-resort guess** — an unresolved name was sent to whichever
> backend was listed *first* in the config. That looked like graceful degradation and was
> a trap. If the first backend is `require_permission`, a caller with no key asking for a
> **free local model** got `401 Model 'x' requires authentication` — an auth error about a
> backend they never chose and cannot see. It happened in production, intermittently,
> whenever live discovery blipped (see below), and was unexplainable from the client side.
> A model nothing is known to serve now says exactly that.

### Slots, priority & queueing

Each backend declares `slots` (max concurrent in-flight requests, shared across all its
models) and `priority` (lower = preferred). When a request arrives the proxy takes a
slot from the **highest-priority candidate that has one free**. When several candidates
**tie on priority**, it round-robins across the tied backends that have a free slot, so
equal-priority backends share load evenly. If all candidates are full it **waits**
(indefinitely by default, or up to `routing.queue_timeout`) for the first slot to free.

> Example: `glm-4.7-flash` runs on `ollamaCitrine` (fast, priority 1) and `ollamaGW`
> (slow, priority 2). Citrine is preferred until full, then gw; if both are full the
> request waits. Two backends at the *same* priority would instead alternate per request.

A released slot is handed **directly** to a chosen waiter, in the same step as the
release — it is never observable as free while somebody is queued for it, so a newly
arrived request cannot barge past the queue.

#### Model affinity: the queue reorders to avoid swaps

Local backends (llama-swap, ollama) hold one model resident and swap on demand, and a
swap costs seconds of load time — usually far more than the request itself. Strict FIFO
provokes the worst case. Take a single-slot `citrine` serving `modelA` and `modelB`:

| | queue order served | backend model loads |
|---|---|---|
| FIFO | `modelA` running → `modelB`, `modelA` | **3** — swap B in, swap A back |
| Affinity | `modelA` running → `modelA`, `modelB` | **2** — A stays, B swaps in once |

So when capacity frees, admission prefers a waiter whose model that backend **already has
resident** — running there now, or the one it just finished — over one that would force a
swap. Measured on a synthetic backend with a 3s swap and 1s generation, that exact
three-request scenario ran in **9.0s instead of 12.0s**, and the second `modelA` request
finished in 3.6s instead of 10.6s. The trade is real and worth stating: `modelB` waited
about a second longer.

This only reorders *waiting* requests. It never changes which backends a request may use,
and never holds a slot idle hoping for a better match — a lone non-matching waiter is
admitted immediately.

**Starvation is bounded.** A waiter passed over `routing.affinity_max_skips` times (default
`3`) is admitted next regardless of what is loaded, so a steady stream of `modelA` cannot
starve `modelB` indefinitely. Set `affinity_max_skips: 0` or `queue_affinity: false` for
strict FIFO.

Watch it work: `llm_proxy_queue_affinity_grants_total` counts reorderings and
`llm_proxy_queue_starvation_yields_total` counts times the cap had to intervene (a
consistently high ratio of yields means the cap is too tight for your traffic). The
In-flight tab marks a passed-over row `passed over N×` and shows each backend's resident
model on its chip.

**In Grafana:** import [`grafana-queue-dashboard.json`](grafana-queue-dashboard.json)
(Dashboards → New → Import → paste the JSON, then pick your Prometheus datasource). Or
query it directly:

```promql
# model loads avoided over the dashboard range
sum(increase(llm_proxy_queue_affinity_grants_total[$__range])) or vector(0)

# reorderings per minute, per backend
sum by (provider) (rate(llm_proxy_queue_affinity_grants_total[$__rate_interval])) * 60

# how often the starvation cap has to step in
sum(increase(llm_proxy_queue_starvation_yields_total[$__range])) or vector(0)
```

The `or vector(0)` is not decoration: a labelled Prometheus counter does not exist until
its first increment, so a panel for a cap that has never fired reads **No data** rather
than zero — which looks like a broken dashboard. Note also that a counter's first ever
sample cannot be an `increase()`, so a freshly created series shows 0 until it moves
again.

### Failover

If a chosen backend errors the proxy releases the slot, marks the backend down for
`routing.down_backoff` seconds, and retries the next-priority target. "Errors" means both
a connection-level failure (connection refused, timeout, …) **and** an upstream HTTP
response whose status is in `routing.failover_statuses` (default `429, 500, 502, 503,
504`) — a backend that answers `503 Service Unavailable` is failed over just like one
that's unreachable. Deliberate 4xx (bad request, auth) are relayed to the client as-is,
since every backend would reject them identically. Once **all** candidates fail, the
client gets the last upstream error verbatim (its real status and body), not a synthetic
502. Streaming requests can fail over up to the first byte (after that the HTTP status is
already committed).

### Context guardrail

A chat client sends the *whole* conversation on every turn. When its own history
management fails, a 512 KB chat goes to a paid backend verbatim — a large bill for a
reply the model cannot ground in a context that size. The proxy is the last hop, so it
enforces the limit the client itself declares.

It acts only when **all** of these hold: the body is a JSON chat with a `messages` list,
it carries an integer `num_ctx` (Open WebUI sends the model's configured context size
this way), and the estimated size exceeds `num_ctx - response_headroom`. A request that
fits — or has no `num_ctx` — is forwarded untouched, byte for byte. Then, in order:

1. **Excerpt old, oversized tool results.** A `role: tool` message deeper than
   `protect_recent` messages from the end and above `max_tool_result_tokens` is cut to a
   head + tail excerpt with a `…[llm-proxy cut N characters…]…` marker. One 20 KB
   `fetch_url` dump buried in history should not force every older turn out.
2. **Drop the oldest turns** until the rest fits. System messages are always kept. An
   assistant message that calls tools and the `tool` results answering it are one block,
   so the window never starts on a dangling call (which most backends reject with a 400).
3. **Always send the newest turn**, even when it alone is over budget: there is nothing
   smaller to send, and the backend's own error is the right answer. The log says so.

Sizes are counted with a real tokenizer: `trim.tokenizer`, a Hugging Face
`tokenizer.json`, by default Qwen's, which the image bakes in at
`/app/tokenizers/qwen3.8.json` (every local model is Qwen3.5 or later, and they share a
vocabulary). Each message is counted the way the chat template prints it — the text of
its content, reasoning and tool-call arguments as-is, not JSON-escaped, plus a few tokens
of template markup per message, call and argument, plus the tool schemas. Sampling fields
are not counted. Against Qwen3.8's real template that lands within ~1% on agent
transcripts, erring high. The tokenizer loads on the first request that needs it (~0.4 s,
~120 MB), and a 600-message session takes ~80 ms to count, off the event loop.

A relative `tokenizer` path is resolved against the config file's directory, so another
`tokenizer.json` can be dropped next to `config.yaml`. Empty, or a file that will not
load (one WARNING, then silence), falls back to the old estimate: serialized JSON
characters divided by `chars_per_token`. That one errs both ways on agent traffic —
1.45× over on source code, 0.8× *under* on an `ls -l` listing, where Qwen spends a token
per digit — so it is only the fallback. Non-text content parts (images) count a flat
~1000 tokens each either way, rather than their base64 length.

Every trim shows up in three places with the same numbers: a `CONTEXT TRIM request #N …`
`WARNING` with the estimate, the budget, messages dropped and tool results excerpted; the
request's `event=request` line gains `trimmed=<dropped> trim_capped=<excerpted>`; and the
In-flight row carries a `trimmed N msgs` badge. `llm_proxy_trims_total{model}` counts them
(keyed by the name the client sent). Turn it off with
`trim.enabled: false`; like the rest of `config.yaml` it hot-reloads.

### Upstream timeouts and connection reuse

All outbound calls share one pooled `httpx` client (`app/upstream.py`), so a request to
a remote backend reuses an established TLS connection instead of renegotiating one.

Its timeouts are split on purpose:

- **read: 600s.** Generation legitimately takes minutes — a large model loading, a long
  prompt to process, or an aggregator that buffers the whole completion before sending
  anything. This is meant to be generous and shouldn't be shortened.
- **connect: 5s.** A TCP handshake completes in the kernel before the request is even
  sent, so no amount of model-loading time lands here. A backend that's down *refuses*
  instantly; the only way to sit waiting on connect is a host that silently drops
  packets — powered off behind a router, or a firewall `DROP` rule — and that connection
  is never going to succeed. Since the request is holding a slot the whole time, one
  such request to a single-slot local backend used to stall it for a full ten minutes,
  with `down_backoff` never kicking in because nothing had failed yet.

### Claude via the Claude Code CLI

A provider with `kind: claude-cli` has no URL: each request runs the official `claude`
binary headless (`claude -p`) inside the proxy's container, logged in with your own
Claude subscription. Usage counts against that plan's limits — the same pool your
interactive Claude Code draws from — not against an API key.

```yaml
  - name: claude
    kind: claude-cli
    require_permission: true      # the subscription is yours: keep it behind the key
    slots: 1                      # one `claude` process at a time
    enabled_models: []            # [] = the CLI's aliases: fable, opus, sonnet, haiku
    model_map:                    # native (CLI alias) -> canonical
      opus: claude-opus
      sonnet: claude-sonnet
```

Log the CLI in once; the login lives in the `/claude` volume and survives recreates:

```bash
docker exec -it llm-proxy claude auth login --claudeai
```

Until then every request answers 502 `Not logged in`. The binary is baked into the image
at a pinned, checksum-verified version (`CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` build arg) with its
self-updater off.

`opus`, `sonnet`, … are the CLI's rolling aliases — always the newest model of the
family, as of the CLI version in the image. The response's `model` field and the request
log's `served=` name the concrete version that answered (`claude-opus-5-5`).

How it fits in: the CLI is an `httpx` transport under the normal forwarding path
(`app/claude_cli.py`), so slots, failover, metrics, the request log and the console's
Kill button behave exactly as for an HTTP backend. A CLI error with an HTTP status is
relayed with that status (a usage-limit 429 fails over like any 429); Anthropic's 529
becomes 503; a refused CLI login becomes 502 rather than a 401 the caller would read as
their own key; a binary that will not start or runs past the 600s read timeout is a
connection failure.

What it serves, and what it refuses:

- **Text chat completions.** Leading system messages become the system prompt; a
  single user message is sent as-is; longer conversations are sent as a role-tagged
  transcript (`claude -p` takes one prompt). `reasoning_effort` maps to `--effort`.
- **Function calling is emulated.** The request's `tools` are listed in the system
  prompt and the model calls them as tools; the proxy catches each call in the CLI's
  event stream, stops the run, and returns it as `tool_calls` for the client to run.
  The results come back in the next request's transcript. Since nothing validates
  the arguments, scalars the model types loosely (`"5"` for an integer) are converted
  to what the function's parameter schema asks for. `tool_choice`
  (`none`/`auto`/`required`/a named function) and `parallel_tool_calls: false` are
  honored, the last two by asking — a call cannot be forced, only which calls go back
  is enforced. Every request re-sends the conversation and the function list, so a
  client with many tools (Open WebUI's native mode sends ~40) spends quota on them on
  every turn; legacy `functions` is refused with a 400.
- **Streaming is synthesized** — the answer (or the calls) arrives as one SSE chunk
  when it is done.
- **Images and audio are refused with a 400**, not silently dropped.
- **The agent is disarmed.** Every built-in tool, MCP server, settings file and slash
  command is switched off and the process runs in an empty directory, because the
  container also holds `config.yaml` with every other backend's API key. Emulated
  function calling changes nothing here: the model only *asks* for a call, and the
  client is what runs it.
- Other OpenAI parameters (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, …) have no CLI equivalent and
  are ignored.

The proxy never touches the CLI's credentials; it only runs the unmodified binary.
Anthropic's terms allow your own subscription in the official CLI and forbid lifting its
token into another client or sharing the account — hence `require_permission: true`.

## Configuration

All routing config lives in `config.yaml` (see `config.example.yaml`). Provider API keys
go inline, or optionally via `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation. Proxy auth keys and runtime
flags come from the environment.

Edits to `config.yaml` are **hot-reloaded** — the file is checked every
`CONFIG_RELOAD_INTERVAL` seconds (default 3, `0` disables) and applied live, no restart
needed. Requests already in flight finish under the settings they started with. A broken
edit (YAML typo) is logged and ignored; the proxy keeps running on the previous config
until the file parses again.

> **Bind-mount gotcha:** with the default single-file mount
> (`./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml`), edit the file **in place** on the host. Editors
> that save by *rename-and-replace* (vim's default, `sed -i`) swap the host inode, and
> the container keeps watching the old file — the edit never becomes visible inside.
> `nano`, a `>` redirect, or `:set backupcopy=yes` in vim write in place. Mounting the
> containing directory instead of the single file avoids the issue entirely.

### Provider fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Backend key, also the `provider:` routing prefix |
| `kind` | `http` (default): an OpenAI-compatible server at `base_url`. `claude-cli`: the Claude Code CLI run in the container — see [Claude via the Claude Code CLI](#claude-via-the-claude-code-cli). The URL/path/header fields below apply to `http` only |
| `base_url` | Upstream base URL (`http` only; required there) |
| `api_key` | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer` upstream. Empty → no auth header (e.g. Ollama) |
| `enabled_models` | Allow-list in **native** ids. **Empty** = expose all (live-queried). **Non-empty** = exactly these (no live call) |
| `slots` | Max concurrent in-flight requests (shared across the backend's models). Omit = unlimited |
| `priority` | Preference when a model has several backends; lower wins. Default = config order. Ties round-robin across backends with a free slot |
| `require_permission` | `true` → gated behind a proxy auth key (default `false`) |
| `strip_path_prefix` | Path segment removed before appending to `base_url`. For OpenAI-compatible backends whose root isn't `/v1` — e.g. Google Gemini (`v1` → its `/v1beta/openai/...`) |
| `strip_fields` | Top-level request-body keys to drop before forwarding. For strict backends that 400 on unknown fields (e.g. Google rejects the `num_ctx` some clients inject) |
| `model_map` | Per-provider **native → canonical** dictionary. Drives `/v1/models` display (native→canonical) and request rewrite (canonical→native). Must be a bijection |
| `provider_routing` | OpenRouter only — per-model upstream pinning, keyed by **native** id (list = strict order, dict = verbatim `provider` field) |
| `headers` | Extra headers sent upstream, applied as **defaults** (a header the client already sent wins). For backend attribution the client can't set itself — e.g. OpenRouter app identity (`HTTP-Referer` / `X-Title`). Values support `${ENV}` |
| `cache_ttl` | Seconds the live `/models` result is cached for this backend |

### Canonical names

`model_map` is keyed by the **native** id, and must be a bijection per provider —
`Provider.__post_init__` inverts it to build the reverse lookup, so two natives sharing a
canonical name make one of them unreachable by that name. Native ids containing a colon
(`qwen3.8-max:thinking`) parse fine unquoted, since YAML only splits on colon-*space*, but
the console quotes them on write:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: nanoGPT
    model_map:
      z-ai/glm-5.2: glm-5.2
      "qwen3.8-max:thinking": qwen-max
```

> Short version, since this is the part everyone forgets: a **canonical name** is what
> clients send (`glm-5.2`) and a **native id** is what one backend calls that same model
> on the wire (`zai-org/glm-5.2` on nanoGPT, `z-ai/glm-5.2` on openRouter). `model_map`
> translates between them, per provider. The console's Config tab has the same
> explanation behind a (?) next to each section.

Clients only ever see and send **canonical** names; native (provider-specific) ids stay
internal. Two layers mint canonical names:

- **`model_map`** (per provider) — the native↔canonical dictionary for *one* backend. A
  pure rename/translation; no routing. Keyed by the native id.
- **`models:`** (global) — the cross-provider routing table in canonical space (priority,
  failover, load-balancing). A target's native id is its explicit `model:`, or — when
  omitted — inherited from that provider's `model_map`.

They compose without overlap: `models:` decides *which backends in what order*; `model_map`
decides *what each backend calls the thing*. A canonical name reachable both as a logical
model and via auto-group resolves as the logical model (it's earlier in the order).

### `models:` and `routing:`

- **`models:`** — declare logical models in canonical space (the flash example). Use an
  explicit `model:` only to pin a specific native id (e.g. a per-box quant); otherwise it's
  inherited from `model_map`. Backends sharing the *same* canonical name auto-group without
  an entry.
- **`routing:`** — `queue_timeout`, `failover`, `auto_group`, `down_backoff`,
  `failover_statuses`, `queue_affinity`, `affinity_max_skips` (see above).
- **`trim:`** — the context guardrail: `enabled`, `tokenizer`, `chars_per_token`, `response_headroom`,
  `max_tool_result_tokens`, `protect_recent` (see [Context guardrail](#context-guardrail)).

### Environment variables

Set in `docker-compose.yml` — **not** in `config.yaml`:

| Env var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PROXY_API_KEYS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated proxy auth keys for gated backends. Empty = gate disabled |
| `LOG_INPUT` | `false` | Log the full proxied request (curl-style, auth masked). Toggleable at runtime via `/logging` |
| `LOG_OUTPUT` | `false` | Log the upstream response (pretty JSON; streaming reassembled). Toggleable at runtime via `/logging` |
| `PORT` | `8000` | Port the proxy binds to inside the container |
| `CONFIG_PATH` | `config.yaml` | Path to the YAML config |
| `CONFIG_RELOAD_INTERVAL` | `3` | Seconds between config-file change checks (hot reload). `0` disables |
| `TZ` | `America/Sao_Paulo` | Timezone for log timestamps (image ships tzdata; timestamps are ISO-8601 with offset) |

| `CLIENT_DNS_TIMEOUT` | `1.0` | Seconds to wait for a reverse-DNS lookup before logging IP-only |
| `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | `true` | Trust `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` for the caller IP (set `false` behind no proxy) |

## Authentication & permissions

Backends marked `require_permission: true` are gated. A request is **authorized** when it
carries `Authorization: Bearer <key>` with a key listed in `PROXY_API_KEYS`.

- **With a valid key** → sees and uses every backend.
- **Without a key** → gated backends are hidden from `/v1/models`, and requests to them
  (including explicit `provider:model` pins) return **401**. Open backends work for everyone.
- **No keys configured** → the gate is inert; everything is open.

> Use case: share your Ollama hosts with a friend (no key, open) while keeping your paid
> DeepSeek/OpenRouter backends private (key required).

## Quick Start

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml   # edit backends, slots, priorities, keys
# set PROXY_API_KEYS and other env vars in docker-compose.yml (see table above)
docker compose up -d
```

Point any OpenAI client at `http://<host>:8000/v1/chat/completions` and request a clean
model name (e.g. `deepseek-v4-flash`). Pass `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for gated backends.

## Endpoints

| Path | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | `GET` | Health check **and build identity**: `{"status":"ok","version":"master-52","revision":"<sha>","release":true}` |
| `/metrics` | `GET` | Prometheus-format metrics |

| `/admin/logs` | `GET` | Recent log lines from an in-memory ring buffer (`?since=<seq>&level=<min>`) |
| `/admin/inflight` | `GET` | The request feed: live (running + queued) plus recent finished ones, with per-provider slot occupancy |
| `/admin/inflight/{id}/cancel` | `POST` | Kill one in-flight request. `404` if it already finished |
| `/admin/inflight/{id}/body` | `GET` | The prompt and reply captured for one row (see `INFLIGHT_BODIES`) |

All `/admin/*` endpoints are gated by the same bearer keys as `POST /logging` (the
log buffer can contain request/response bodies when `LOG_INPUT`/`LOG_OUTPUT` are on),
and never serialize provider `api_key`s.

### Web console (`/ui/`)

A built-in, dependency-free dashboard served by the proxy itself — open
`http://<host>:9999/ui/` and paste a proxy key (stored in your browser's
`localStorage`, sent as `Authorization: Bearer`). Five tabs:

- **Logging** — live log tail (level filter, pause, autoscroll) plus the
  `LOG_INPUT` / `LOG_OUTPUT` runtime toggles.
- **In-flight** — what the proxy is doing *right now*, polled every second, as a rolling
  feed: **live requests pinned on top** (newest first), then the recently finished ones
  below a divider. Every row is numbered with the request id.
  - A **running** row shows the backend it landed on, the native model id, live token
    counts, and — for streams — a chunk counter that ticks as tokens arrive. A **queued**
    row shows which backends it is waiting on and for how long. Both carry age /
    queued-for / running-for.
  - **Live token counts** come with a caveat worth knowing: an upstream reports `usage`
    only in its *final* streaming chunk (verified against llama.cpp — 1 chunk in 33), so
    while a request runs, `tok out` is the proxy's own count of generation steps, shown as
    `~40`, and is replaced by the authoritative number the instant usage arrives. `tok in`
    is genuinely unknowable before then and reads `0`. A buffered (non-streaming) request
    reveals nothing until it returns, so both read `0` while it runs.
  - **`tok/s`** is the same figure the request log emits as `speed_tps`: output tokens over
    the time the upstream exchange took — queue wait excluded, prompt processing included,
    because the clock starts when the request is sent rather than at the first token. A
    running row shows the average so far (over the `~` estimate, so it carries a `~` too)
    and reads `0.00` until the first token lands; a finished row shows the final number,
    computed from the very duration the log line used. Embeddings and rerankers generate
    nothing, so their `tok/s` is input tokens/s, as in the log's `in_tps`.
  - A **finished** row is frozen at completion with its status, total time, queue wait and
    token counts (`done` / `cancelled` / `failed`, colour-coded). History is capped by
    `INFLIGHT_HISTORY` and is lost on restart by design — the durable per-request record is
    the `event=request` log line.
  - Every row shows who called (service from the `User-Agent`, plus IP and reverse-DNS name)
    and the request body size.
  - Badges on the first line flag what happened to a request on the way through:
    `attempt 2` (failed over), `passed over N×` (queue affinity), and **`trimmed N msgs`**
    when the [context guardrail](#context-guardrail) dropped history — hover it for the
    token estimate against the budget and how many tool results were excerpted.
  - **Body** expands the row to show the prompt this request sent and the reply that came
    back — pretty-printed, with a thinking model's reasoning kept separate from its answer.
    On a running request the reply fills in as it streams. This is the reason it exists:
    reading one request end-to-end here beats grepping it out of a log stream that also
    carries every `/metrics` scrape. Bodies are fetched per row on demand, never in the
    1s poll.
  - **Kill** cancels a live request, on a single click. Works on a queued request *and* on
    one wedged in an upstream read that will never return; the slot is freed immediately
    and the caller gets a `503`. See [Killing a request](#killing-a-request).
  - The toolbar totals running / queued / done and shows each provider's `in_use/slots`,
    amber when full — so a growing queue reads straight against the capacity causing it.
    See [Slots, priority & queueing](#slots-priority--queueing).
- **Config** — edit `config.yaml` from the browser; every save rewrites the file
  (comments preserved) and takes effect immediately, no restart.
  - **Upstream models** — per backend, either *allow all* (use whatever it live-reports)
    or an explicit list. **Probe backend** fetches its real catalog as checkboxes; an id
    that is pinned but no longer reported stays visible and checked, marked
    *not in catalog*, so saving cannot silently drop it. A paid provider can report
    hundreds of ids, so the list has a **filter** plus **Tick shown** / **Untick shown**
    for bulk selection of whatever the filter matches — typing and ticking never re-render
    the list, so focus and scroll position survive.
  - **Model groups** — add, edit and delete logical models: pick each target's backend,
    native id (blank inherits from `model_map`) and priority.
  - **Aliases** — add, edit and delete short names. An alias pointing at an unknown
    provider is refused rather than written, since an alias resolves ahead of everything
    else and a broken one silently breaks a model name.
  - Every pinned id is tagged with **what a client actually has to send** for it:
    `→ glm-5.3 group` when a group fronts it, `→ deepseek-v4-flash model_map` when the
    provider renames it, and nothing when neither applies — because then the raw native
    id *is* the public name. A summary line above the list counts all three
    ("1 behind a group · 1 renamed by model_map · 4 exposed under the raw id") and names
    the raw ones, since pinning a model does **not** give it a clean name and that is the
    single most common misreading of this page.
  - **Name mapping** per backend edits its `model_map` — `native id → what clients call
    it` — which is how a native id gets a clean public name without a group. The mapping
    must be one-to-one: two native ids sharing a canonical name would make the reverse
    lookup pick one silently, so that is refused with a pointer to groups (which is what
    the multi-backend case actually wants).
  - The **add a native model id** field pins exactly one id into the allow-list — it is
    not where renaming happens. Anything with a space or an arrow (`a -> b`) is rejected
    and points at Name mapping, because that mistake used to be accepted verbatim as an
    id that could never match anything.
  - Each section has a **(?)** panel explaining the concepts in place — including a
    walkthrough of the same model's name at each hop (backend reports `zai-org/glm-5.2`
    → `model_map` renames it → client asks for `glm-5.2` → proxy sends
    `zai-org/glm-5.2`), which is the thing worth having on screen while you are staring
    at a list of native ids.
  - `api_key` values are never sent to the browser; a provider shows only whether one is
    set. Editing secrets and adding/removing whole providers stay file-side for now.

#### Killing a request

The **Kill** button cancels the asyncio task serving that request, which unwinds the
ordinary cleanup path: the slot is released, the upstream connection closed, and the
request moves into the history as `cancelled`. Cancellation rather than a flag, because
the requests worth killing are blocked inside an `await` — a queued one inside the slot
waiter future, a running one inside an upstream read that may never return.

What the caller sees depends on how far the request got:

- **Queued, or a buffered (non-streaming) response** — a clean `503` with
  `{"error": {"type": "cancelled"}}`, the same shape as a queue timeout.
- **Mid-stream** — the SSE stream simply ends. The `200` was committed with the first
  chunk, so there is no status code left to send; the client sees a truncated completion
  and a normal end of body.

Each kill is logged at `WARNING` with the request id, model, backend and elapsed time.
- **Models** — the aggregated catalog, plus a **Probe upstreams** button that queries
  each backend's real `/v1/models` so every endpoint's full list is visible at once
  (independent of `enabled_models`).
- **Routing** — each logical model drawn as connected boxes (model → prioritized
  targets) with live down/busy badges; rearrange priorities with `↑`/`↓` or by editing
  the number. Edits apply immediately **and are written back into the config file**.
  Auto-grouped models and aliases are shown read-only.

#### How console edits reach the file

Every console edit rewrites `config.yaml` through a **ruamel.yaml round-trip**, so
comments, key order, quoting and blank lines survive. Measured on this project's own
production config (189 lines, 31 comments): a round-trip keeps every comment and
produces a semantically identical document. The one irreducible change is
hand-alignment *padding inside flow maps* —
`{provider: nanoGPT,␣␣␣␣␣␣priority: 2}` becomes `{provider: nanoGPT,␣priority: 2}`,
because ruamel does not track intra-flow spacing. That normalization happens **once**,
on the first console write.

Requirements & behavior:

- The config volume must be mounted **read-write** (the bundled compose does this).
  On a `:ro` mount the change is refused with *"not persisted"* and the file is
  untouched; the Config and Routing tabs show a read-only warning.
- **Abort-don't-corrupt.** Every edit is serialized, re-parsed with plain PyYAML, and
  checked to contain exactly the requested change *before* the file is opened for
  writing. A mutation may never add or remove a provider — that guard is explicit.
  Any surprise aborts with a reason and leaves the file byte-identical.
- The write is **in-place** (`r+` + truncate), never write-temp-then-rename:
  `/app/config.yaml` is a single-file bind mount, so a rename would detach from the
  host inode.
- The edit is applied to the live process before the response returns, so the console
  re-renders from the file rather than from what it hoped it wrote.
- `api_key` values are read and written back verbatim and **never** leave the process.
  A provider reports only `has_api_key`.

**Inherited vs. explicit native ids.** A target's `model:` may be omitted, meaning
"inherit the native id from this provider's `model_map`". The editor keeps that
distinction: an inherited target shows an empty field with the resolved id as a
greyed `inherits …` placeholder, and saving it unchanged does **not** write an
explicit pin. Otherwise opening a group and pressing Save would silently harden every
inherited id — changing what the config means without changing what it says.

### `/models` aggregation

Lists, deduplicated, in **canonical** names: aliases, logical models, and each remaining
canonical model once (native ids translated through `model_map`). A model served by several
backends appears a **single** time (the proxy load-balances behind it). Backend-prefixed
`provider:model` ids are **not** listed — they still work for pinning a specific backend, but
advertising them would just duplicate the clean names. Likewise, anything a logical model
fronts is **hidden** — both its canonical name and the concrete native ids of its targets —
so clients use the stable logical name instead, and per-backend variants (e.g. quantizations)
don't flap in and out of the list as backends come and go. Live-discovered backends are queried (`GET {base_url}/v1/models`),
cached for `cache_ttl`, coalesced via single-flight so a burst of cold requests triggers one
probe per backend; offline backends drop out.

**A failed probe does not blank a backend.** A local backend busy loading a model can miss
its `/v1/models` window, and treating that as "this box has no models" made every model on
it unresolvable for a full `cache_ttl`. Instead the last catalog that *did* succeed stands
in for up to 5 minutes (`registry.STALE_GRACE`), re-probing every 15s while it does, and is
logged each time. Past that window a backend that is still failing really is gone and its
models drop out of the listing. Gated backends are hidden from callers
without a valid key.

## Prometheus Metrics

Scrape `http://<host>:8000/metrics`:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llm_proxy_requests_total` | Counter | `provider`, `model` | Completed requests |
| `llm_proxy_tokens_input_total` | Counter | `provider`, `model` | Cumulative input tokens |
| `llm_proxy_tokens_output_total` | Counter | `provider`, `model` | Cumulative output tokens |
| `llm_proxy_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `provider`, `model` | Request latency (0.1–600s) |
| `llm_proxy_errors_total` | Counter | `provider`, `model`, `status_code` | Failed requests |
| `llm_proxy_slots_in_use` | Gauge | `provider` | In-flight requests holding a slot |
| `llm_proxy_queue_waiting` | Gauge | — | Requests currently waiting for a slot |
| `llm_proxy_failovers_total` | Counter | `provider` | Failovers away from a backend |
| `llm_proxy_queue_affinity_grants_total` | Counter | `provider` | Times the queue admitted a request ahead of an earlier one to avoid a model swap |
| `llm_proxy_queue_starvation_yields_total` | Counter | `provider` | Times `affinity_max_skips` forced FIFO to unblock a passed-over request |
| `llm_proxy_trims_total` | Counter | `model` | Requests whose conversation was shrunk to fit the `num_ctx` they declared (see [Context guardrail](#context-guardrail)) |

> **Metric prefix:** as of the multi-backend rework these use `llm_proxy_` (was
> `deepseek_proxy_`). Update existing Grafana/alert queries accordingly.

### Counters reset on restart — on purpose

In-memory counters go back to zero when the proxy restarts. Prometheus recognises that
as a counter reset and compensates for it, so `rate()` and `increase()` stay correct
across a reboot; all you lose is the sliver of traffic between the last scrape and the
shutdown.

**Do not "fix" this by snapshotting the counters to disk and re-seeding them on boot.**
This repo shipped exactly that (`METRICS_PERSIST`) and it was removed, because it turns a
harmless reset into a fabricated spike. The snapshot always lags the last scrape a little,
so the counter comes back *lower* than the value Prometheus already read. Prometheus reads
any decrease as a reset-to-zero and credits the **entire pre-drop value** as fresh
increase — the phantom is the size of the whole counter, not the size of the dip. On
2026-08-26 a two-request lag reported 1260 requests and 36.6 M input tokens inside a
21-minute window for a local model that had served two.

For long-range totals, use the reset-proof `:increase5m` recording rules
(`monitoring/recording-rules.yml` in the deploy repo) rather than reading the raw counter:

```promql
sum_over_time(llm_proxy_requests_total:increase5m[$__range])
```

Live gauges (`slots_in_use`, `queue_waiting`) and the latency histogram reflect the current
process and reset too — that is what they are for.

## Request Logging

Every completed request — success **or** error — emits exactly one structured
[logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) line on stdout:

```
ts=2026-06-17T02:48:13-03:00 level=info event=request provider=openRouter model=z-ai/glm-5.2 asked=glm-5.2 status=200 stream=true in=5524 out=890 dur=0:00:26 speed_tps=34.91 client_ip=192.168.1.50 client_host=workstation.lan svc=OpenWebUI ua="OpenWebUI/0.5"
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ts` | ISO-8601 timestamp **with offset** (local time per `TZ`; unambiguous regardless of reader) |
| `provider`, `model` | Backend chosen and the **native** model id sent to it |
| `asked` | The model name the **client** sent, when it differs from `model`. A group spanning three backends resolves to three different native ids, so `model=` alone splits one model's traffic across three series — and a failover moves a request between them mid-flight. Group by `asked` to chart what people actually requested; omitted when the two names are identical |
| `served` | The model the backend's **response** says it ran, when it differs from `model`. A native id is often a rolling alias — the [Claude CLI](#claude-via-the-claude-code-cli)'s `opus`, an aggregator's unversioned slug — and this is where the concrete version that answered (`claude-opus-5-5`) is recorded; omitted when the backend echoes the id it was sent |
| `status` | Upstream HTTP status relayed to the client |
| `stream` | Whether the response was streamed |
| `in`, `out`, `dur` | Prompt/completion tokens and wall-clock duration as `H:MM:SS` (rounded up to the second, so a fast request reads `0:00:01` not `0:00:00`) |
| `speed_tps` | Output tokens/s. **Omitted for embeddings & rerankers** — they return no completion tokens, so it would always be a misleading `0.00` |
| `op`, `in_tps` | Present only on no-output ops (**`embedding`**, **`rerank`**): the op kind plus input tokens/s — the throughput that matters when nothing is generated |
| `client_ip` | Caller address (`X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` honored when `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS`) |
| `client_host` | Reverse-DNS of `client_ip` (omitted if unresolved or `RESOLVE_CLIENT_HOST=false`) |
| `svc`, `ua` | Service guessed from the User-Agent's leading token, and the full User-Agent |
| `err` | Short error category (`invalid_request`, `unauthorized`, `rate_limited`, `upstream_error`…); absent on success |
| `trimmed`, `trim_capped` | Present only when the [context guardrail](#context-guardrail) shrank the request: messages dropped and old tool results cut to an excerpt. `{trimmed!=""}` in Loki finds every trimmed request; the matching `CONTEXT TRIM request #N …` WARNING has the token estimates |

An **embedding or rerank** request returns no completion tokens (`out=0`), so it's tagged
`op=embedding` / `op=rerank` and reports `in_tps` (input tokens/s) in place of `speed_tps` —
an output-tokens/s figure would just be a constant `0.00` that skews throughput panels.
Detection is by request path (`/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/rerank`, …) **and** model id (e.g. a
`*-Reranker-*` / `*-Embedding-*` name), so it works even on a nonstandard path:

```
ts=2026-06-30T12:24:12-03:00 level=info event=request provider=ollamaGW model=Qwen3-Reranker-8B op=rerank status=200 stream=false in=9515 out=0 dur=0:00:12 in_tps=792.92 client_ip=172.19.0.19 client_host=open-webui.main svc=python-requests ua=python-requests/2.34.2
```

A request whose body carries no resolvable `model` (a non-chat / multipart passthrough —
forwarded untouched to the first provider) is logged instead as **`event=passthrough`**,
keyed by `method` + `path` rather than a model, e.g.:

```
ts=2026-06-17T12:10:23-03:00 level=info event=passthrough provider=deepseek method=POST path=/models status=405 stream=false client_ip=192.168.0.79 client_host=luis.brandao svc=PostmanRuntime ua="PostmanRuntime/7.52.0" err=invalid_request
```

So `model=` never appears as `unknown`, and these requests stay out of per-model dashboards
(they're also excluded from the `llm_proxy_*` model metrics). Split them in Loki with
`| logfmt | event="request"` vs `event="passthrough"`.

Because it's logfmt, Loki/Grafana parse it with no regex:

```logql
{container="llm-proxy"} | logfmt | status>=`400`            # all failed requests
{container="llm-proxy"} | logfmt | provider=`openRouter`    # one backend
sum by (client_host) (count_over_time({container="llm-proxy"} | logfmt [1h]))  # calls per caller machine
```

The line is emitted **after** the response is delivered (background task / stream
end), so reverse-DNS never adds latency to the caller.

`LOG_INPUT` logs the full proxied request curl-style (auth masked); `LOG_OUTPUT` logs the
upstream response pretty-printed (streaming reassembled into one JSON with
`_assembled_content` / `_reasoning_content`). These verbose dumps and uvicorn's access/error
logs use the human-readable `<ts> LEVEL <msg>` format (same ISO-8601 timestamp).

Both flags can be flipped at runtime — no restart required:

```bash
curl http://<host>:8000/logging                          # current state
curl -X POST http://<host>:8000/logging \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" \
  -d '{"log_input": true, "log_output": true}'           # either key optional
```

The `POST` requires a valid proxy key when `PROXY_API_KEYS` is set (otherwise open). The
env vars still set the state at boot; runtime changes are not persisted across restarts.

### Error logging & relay

Upstream errors are **always logged with their response body** (WARNING level, pretty-printed,
truncated at 4 KB) regardless of `LOG_OUTPUT` — the body is where the backend says *why* it
rejected the request:

```
2026-06-11T23:42:22-03:00 WARNING Upstream error 400 from 'google' (model: gemini-2.5-pro):
{
  "error": { "code": 400, "message": "Unknown name 'num_ctx': Cannot find field.", ... }
}
```

The error body and status are also relayed to the client verbatim — including on **streaming**
requests, where the upstream's 4xx/5xx is returned as a plain JSON response instead of being
wrapped in a bogus `200` SSE stream. The one-line `event=request … status=400 err=invalid_request`
summary above is emitted in addition, so you can both alert on it and read the full reason.

> **Streaming token counts:** upstreams only emit a `usage` block in a streamed response
> when the request sets `stream_options: {"include_usage": true}`. The proxy **injects
> this automatically** on streamed requests (unless the client explicitly set it), so
> token metrics/logs are reliable for streams too. As a result the client receives a final
> usage chunk (standard OpenAI streaming behavior). Non-streaming always reports usage.

## CI / CD

Pushes to `master` (ignoring `.md`-only changes) build the Docker image and push to GitHub
Container Registry, tagged `latest` and `master-{run_number}`, using `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** + **uvicorn** — async ASGI
- **httpx** — async client with streaming
- **prometheus-client** — native metrics
- **PyYAML** — config parsing
- **ruamel.yaml** — comment-preserving config *writes* from the console
- **pytest** + **pytest-asyncio** — test suite (dev only, see below)
- **Python 3.11**

## Versioning

The image tag and the version the process reports are the **same string**, so you
can always tell whether the container answering requests is the build you pinned.

CI passes the build identity into the image:

```yaml
build-args: |
  APP_VERSION=master-${{ github.run_number }}   # identical to the image tag
  APP_REVISION=${{ github.sha }}
```

The Dockerfile turns those into `ENV`, and `app/version.py` reads them once at
startup. It shows up in four places:

| Where | Looks like |
|---|---|
| Startup log | `llm-proxy master-52 (1e5837a3) starting — 8 providers, 9 logical models, 0 aliases` |
| `GET /health` | `{"status":"ok","version":"master-52","revision":"1e5837a3…","release":true}` |
| `GET /metrics` | `llm_proxy_build_info{version="master-52",revision="1e5837a3…"} 1.0` |
| Console header | a `master-52` chip next to the title, hover for the commit |

Built outside CI (a plain `docker build`, or running from a checkout) the version
is `dev` with `release: false` — a truthful answer rather than a misleading
number.

Two things this makes possible that weren't before:

```bash
# does the running process agree with what the compose file pins?
curl -s gw.brandao:8000/health | jq -r .version

# alert on a fleet running mixed builds
count(count by (version) (llm_proxy_build_info)) > 1
```

`/health` is unauthenticated, like `/metrics` — this is a build counter, not a
CVE-mappable version string, on a proxy that already lists its catalog to
anonymous callers.

## Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

202 tests, no network, about a second. They exist to pin the properties that
are invisible in review: that every acquired slot is released on every exit path

all still there. `AGENTS.md` has the per-file breakdown.
