    outcome (status, token counts, speed) and whether it streamed. Runs after
    the response is delivered (background task / stream finally) so the
    reverse-DNS lookup never adds latency to the client.

    `model` is the **native** id that went on the wire, and stays that way for
    compatibility with existing dashboards and recording rules. `asked` is the
    name the *client* sent, emitted as its own `asked=` field, because those two
    routinely differ and only one of them is a stable thing to group by: a
    logical model spanning three backends resolves to three different native ids
    via each provider's model_map, so `model=` alone splits one model's traffic
    across three series — and a request that fails over moves between them
    mid-flight. `asked=` is what somebody actually typed into a client, so it is
    the field to sum over. Both are kept: the native id is what you need to ask a
    backend about its own logs.

    `served` is the third name: the `model` the backend's *response* reports
    having run, emitted as `served=` when it differs from the native id. A
    native id is often a rolling alias — the claude CLI's `opus`, an
    aggregator's unversioned slug — and this is the only place the concrete
    version that answered (`claude-opus-5-5`) is recorded. Omitted when the
    backend echoes the id it was sent, so most lines are unchanged.

    A model-less passthrough (non-chat / multipart body, nothing to resolve) is
    logged as `event=passthrough` keyed by request path — never as a bogus
    `model=unknown`, which would pollute the per-model view.

    `trimmed` is what the context guardrail did to this request (app/trim.py),
    emitted as `trimmed=<messages dropped>` and `trim_capped=<tool results cut>`
