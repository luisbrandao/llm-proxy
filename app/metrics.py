# NOTE: these counters are deliberately NOT persisted across restarts. A restart
# resets them to zero, which Prometheus recognises as a counter reset and handles
# correctly in rate()/increase(). Re-seeding them from a snapshot is what breaks
# that: the file always lags the last scrape a little, so the counter comes back
# *lower* than the value Prometheus already read. Prometheus reads any decrease
# as a reset-to-zero and credits the entire pre-drop value as fresh increase — a
# two-request lag once turned into a phantom 1190-request, 36M-token spike inside
# a 21-minute window. For lifetime totals use the `:increase5m` recording rules,
# which are reset-proof, instead of reading the raw counter.
