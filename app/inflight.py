"""Live request feed — what is running, what is queued for a slot, what just ran.

The Routing tab already answers *how many* slots each provider has in use; this
answers the next question: **which** requests those are, and what is stacked up
behind them. `slots.py` keeps only a per-provider counter and a list of `_Waiter`
objects holding bare futures — nothing in there records what a waiting request
*is*, so a request stuck waiting for capacity is invisible from the outside.
Registering every proxied request on arrival makes both sets enumerable.

A finished request is not dropped: it is frozen and moved to the front of a
`_recent` ring buffer, so the console shows a rolling feed (newest first) rather
than a view that empties whenever the proxy goes idle. That history is
deliberately in-memory and lost on restart, exactly like the log ring buffer —
the durable copy of every request is its `event=request` log line. Size:
`INFLIGHT_HISTORY`.

State is process-local, exactly like `slots._in_use`, `registry._down_until` and
the log ring buffer: correct because the app runs a single uvicorn worker.

**Observation only**, with one deliberate exception (`Entry.cancel`, driven from
the admin API — never from the request path). Nothing in the request path reads
this registry to make a decision, and every mutator is a plain attribute/dict
write with no `await` in it, so an entry can never be seen half-updated and a bug
here cannot change admission, routing or failover behavior.

Lifecycle — exactly one owner closes each entry, mirroring the slot lifecycle:

    proxy.proxy_request   begin()             state=queued, registered
    proxy._dispatch       Entry.wait(targets) state=queued  (re-armed per attempt)
                          Entry.run(target)   state=running (slot acquired)
    both handlers         Entry.record(...)   outcome: status, token counts, upstream time
    non-stream            proxy.proxy_request closes it — the buffered Response
                          is complete by the time the handler returns
    stream                proxy._handle_stream's generator `finally` closes it,
                          the same place the slot is released (the handler
                          returns long before the body is done)

`finish()` is idempotent — it moves the entry into the history exactly once,
using its own removal from `_active` as the guard.

Cancellation: each entry keeps a reference to the asyncio task serving it, so the
console can kill a request (`Entry.cancel`). See that method for why cancelling
the task — rather than setting a flag someone has to poll — is the mechanism.
