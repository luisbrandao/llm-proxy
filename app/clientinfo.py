"""Best-effort identification of the calling client, for the per-request log.

Pulls out three things, none of which gate the request — they exist purely to
make a log line answer "who called, from which machine, with what tool":

* `client_ip`   — the caller's address, honoring `X-Forwarded-For` /
  `X-Real-IP` when proxy headers are trusted (with `network_mode: host` and no
  front proxy this is already the real LAN IP).
* `client_host` — reverse-DNS of that IP, resolved off the event loop, time
  bounded and cached (positive and negative), so a chatty client triggers at
  most one lookup per TTL. Falls back to None when DNS has nothing.
* service token — the leading product of the `User-Agent`, a rough "what app".
